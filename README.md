snipcon-OSX
===========

A simple utility to convert Textexpander snippets to OS X .plist files that can be imported via drag-and-drop into OS X System Preferences > Keyboard > Text

At this point, the output .plist requires manual editing to get rid of fill-ins, date placeholders, & scripts -- the conversion works with plain text substitutions only.
